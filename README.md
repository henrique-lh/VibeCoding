# VibeCoding

Yes, my friend... I know you're afraid AI will take your job, and you worry about losing your life's purpose and the joy of writing your own code - the thrill of finding a solution and solving it with your skills.
However, we're in a new era, the vibe era. Let's vibe!

My goal here is simple: to create random projects and code them. If you'd like to join me and vibe together, send a PR showcasing your prompt engineering skills and prove you're ready for the vibe
